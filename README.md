# AI Incident Assistant (GenAI Support Project)

## Overview

This project demonstrates how Generative AI can assist Application Support teams in analyzing production incidents safely and efficiently.

The assistant generates structured incident summaries, risk ratings, KPI recommendations, and confidence scoring while minimizing hallucination risk.

## Problem Statement

Incident analysis and reporting are manual, time-consuming, and prone to inconsistency. This project uses prompt-engineered AI to automate and standardize incident analysis.

## Features

Incident summary generation

Impact assessment

Root cause analysis (with hallucination control)

Risk rating assignment

KPI recommendations

Alert threshold recommendations

Confidence scoring (High / Medium / Low)

## Hallucination Control Measures

Uses only provided incident data

Explicitly states when data is insufficient

Separates facts from inference

Assigns confidence levels

## Sample Use Case

Incident: Payment portal failure due to backend service timeout.

Output:

Structured incident report

Risk classification: High

Confidence scoring applied

## Skills Demonstrated

Generative AI application in IT Operations

Prompt engineering

Incident management automation

AI safety and hallucination mitigation

AIOps fundamentals
