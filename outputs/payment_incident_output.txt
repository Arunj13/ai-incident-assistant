### Incident Overview  
**FACT:** Date: **Feb 2026**; System: **Internal Payment Portal**; Issue: **Users unable to submit payments**; Error observed: **504 Gateway Timeout**.  
**FACT:** Incident start time **09:20 AM**, end time **11:10 AM**; duration **1 hour 50 minutes**.  
**FACT:** Resolution recorded as **Restarted backend service**.  
**FACT:** **High CPU usage observed** during the incident.

**INFERENCE:** The restart of the backend service coincided with restoration of payment submission functionality. *(Confidence: Medium — temporal correlation only.)*

### Impact Assessment  
**FACT:** **Approx 800 users** affected.  
**FACT:** Payment submission functionality returned 504 Gateway Timeout responses while the incident was active.  
**INFERENCE:** Business impact included interruption of payment processing for affected users during the incident window. *(Confidence: High — direct consequence of users unable to submit payments.)*

---

### Probable Root Cause  
**FACT:** High CPU usage was observed; backend service was restarted.  
**ROOT-CAUSE STATEMENT:** **Root cause cannot be determined from available data.**  
**INFERENCE:** High CPU usage is a plausible contributing factor but a definitive causal link is not provided in the incident data. *(Confidence: Medium for the inference; High for the statement that root cause cannot be determined from available data.)*

### Resolution Summary  
**FACT:** At **11:10 AM** the backend service was restarted (documented as the resolution action).  
**FACT:** Service availability for payment submissions was restored after the restart.  
**INFERENCE:** The restart removed the immediate symptom (timeouts); whether it addressed an underlying fault is not known. *(Confidence: Medium.)*

---

### Risk Rating  
**High** — based strictly on the described impact (payment failures affecting ~800 users and interruption of financial transaction capability).

---

### KPIs to Monitor  
1. **Backend CPU Utilization (5‑minute average)** — measurable percentage; recommended target \< 70%. *(Rationale: direct observation of high CPU during incident.)*  
2. **Payment Submission Success Rate (per minute)** — measurable as successful payment responses ÷ total payment attempts; recommended target ≥ 99.9%.

---

### Alert Threshold Recommendation  
**Trigger an alert when:** **average backend CPU utilization > 80% for 5 continuous minutes AND payment submission success rate < 99.5% in the same 5‑minute window.**  
**Rationale:** Combines resource pressure with functional degradation to reduce false positives and prompt investigation before broad user impact.

### Confidence Level (summary)  
- **Facts reported above:** **High** (directly stated in incident data).  
- **Inferences (e.g., CPU as contributing factor; restart correlation):** **Medium** (logical inference from observed correlation but not proven).  
- **Root cause determination:** **High** confidence that it **cannot** be determined from the available data.

If you want, I can convert the KPIs and alert threshold into monitoring dashboard queries (example metric names and time windows) using only the facts above.
